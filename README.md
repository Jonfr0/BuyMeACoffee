# First Smart Contract!

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## Project Description
With this project I wanted to learn and understand the basics of Smart Contracts and Solidity programming. Along the way, I have been introduced to Remix, Hardhat, Javascript, Nodejs, Git, Yarn & npm (package managers), linters, tests and gas fees. I'm expecting to learn way more about Blockchain and Web3 in the future and I will keep updating my GitHub with more projects.
